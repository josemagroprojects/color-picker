# Color Picker
<br/>

### What I wished as a result
I wanted to create a solution to change the color of a certain image, like for example the Muzli solution I show in the video.

<br/>
### What I achieved
I used a Svg and I created multiple swatches that change the color of the elements of those graphics. For this I used React and I used the following package.

I can gladly say that I achieved the desired result. __This is the result__

### What problems I solved
I canâ€™t say that this solves a specific problem, even though this could be a solution for an application where the user can simulate the color of certain elements
